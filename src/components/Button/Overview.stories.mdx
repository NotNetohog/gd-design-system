# Button

Buttons are used to show the userâ€™s choice of options for actions and assign these to a clear hierarchy. A button helps the user to find the most important actions of a page or within a viewport and enables them to perform these actions. The label is used to clearly indicate to the user what action will be triggered. Buttons allow users to commit a change, complete steps in a task, or make choices.

## Examples

Below is an overview of the Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary button components.

### Primary Button

The primary button is used for the most important action on a page or in a view.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-buttons-all-stories--primary-button" />
</Canvas>

### Secondary Button

The secondary button with a thin frame is used for subordinate actions.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-buttons-all-stories--secondary-button" />
</Canvas>

### Tertiary Button

The tertiary button is applied as a subtle call to action.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-buttons-all-stories--tertiary-button" />
</Canvas>

## Usage guidelines

### Best practices

- Buttons are either primary color or secondary color.

- Use a primary button for the next best action. Remaining calls-to-action should be represented as secondary or tertiary buttons.

- Use buttons in consistent locations in the user interface to improve user experience.

- Only use one primary button per viewport, no limits per page.

- Button labels must describe the action the button will perform and should include a verb. Use concise, specific, self-explanatory labels.

- Button labels should always include a noun if there is any room for interpretation about what the verb operates on.

- Do not use generic labels like "Ok," especially in the case of an error; errors are never "Ok".

- Use the button group component when there is a need to combine or lay out multiple buttons, and express different emphasis levels (e.g. one primary button and one secondary button).

- Do not use two primary buttons in a button group.

- Do not use a primary button with a tertiary button in a button group.

- Do not use a button for a text link or navigation item.

### Use cases

- Key calls to action, such as "Deposit cash" or "Create a campaign."

- Supporting calls to action, such as "Save draft" or "Cancel creation"

- Alongside an input field, when there is an action to be taken after the user has inputted their information (e.g. searching for groups).
