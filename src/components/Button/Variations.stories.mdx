## Primary button

The primary button is used for the most important action on a page or in a view.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-buttons-all-stories--primary-button" />

### States

Primary buttons have idle, disabled, hover, active, and focus states. Head to the Canvas tab on the Properties page to interact with the different states and options that are possible.

### Sizes

The size of the primary button depends on the base font size used which can be adapted to the viewport width.

The secondary button is used for subordinate actions.

### Other button variations

#### Icon button

The icon button allows an icon to be placed to the left of the label.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-buttons-all-stories--icon-buttons" />
</Canvas>

#### Stretched button

Stretched buttons indicate the most important function of a page or view. It should also be used for small viewports.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-buttons-all-stories--stretched-button" />
</Canvas>

## Button groups

Buttons can be grouped to offer several actions alongside each other. The number of buttons should be easy for the user to grasp. A single, important action can be emphasised as the primary button in order to guide the user.

### Primary and secondary groups

The primary button emphasises a more important action compared to the secondary button. Only one primary button is used per view, but this can be combined with several secondary buttons.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-buttons-all-stories--primary-groups" />
</Canvas>

### Secondary groups

Unlike primary buttons, secondary buttons can be combined directly adjacent to one another if the options for actions offered are equivalent.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-buttons-all-stories--secondary-groups" />
</Canvas>

### Tertiary groups

Tertiary buttons can likewise be grouped directly adjacently to one another. However, they are not mixed in a button group with primary or secondary buttons that are immediately adjacent.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-buttons-all-stories--tertiary-groups" />
</Canvas>
